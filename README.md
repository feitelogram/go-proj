# Take A Peek!
### A short project for learning GoLang/Vue!

This was a short project I did to learn both how to write and deploy a server in **GoLang** and how to work with **Vue.js**!

I knew both of them were popular and I wanted to learn how to use them so I found some fun docs on the internet and created a simple site for looking up a screenshot of a given website.

If you'd like to see a deployed version, feel free to checkout [Take A Peek!](http://take-a-peek.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.

Otherwise if you want to try it:

1. Fork the project.
2. `git clone <your-forked-project>`
3. Go to [ScreenshotApi](https://screenshotapi.net) and get an API key.
4. `cd go-proj`
5. `cd frontend`
6. `npm i`
7. `cd..`
8. `export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`
9. `go run main/server.go`
10. Go to `http://localhost:3000` and check out the app!

Thanks again for checking it out and know I'm excited to learn more about **GoLang** and **Vue**!
